###Hi there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">,

I'm **Saad El Kharraz**, a 21-year-old data analyst based in Spain. After graduating from high school with a degree in Computer Science, I developed a passion for data and decided to pursue a career in Data Analysis.

I am a certified Google Data Analytics Professional and have completed a comprehensive course in Python for Data Science and Machine Learning. I have honed my skills in data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning techniques.

Check out my **<a href="https://github.com/ElkSaad/Data-Analyst-Portfolio"> portfolio</a>** to see some of the data analysis projects that I have completed independently, as well as in collaboration with other data analysts. My projects showcase my proficiency in working with real-world datasets, data cleaning, data manipulation, exploratory data analysis, and visualization.
